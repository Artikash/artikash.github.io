<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	Hello! My real name is Akash Mozumdar, though online I typically use the handle Artikash*, and I'm a software
	engineer currently working at Amazon. I've created several open source software projects, most notably
	<a href="https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor">Textractor</a>, and I occasionally contribute to other peoples'. I
	love strategy games including Chess, Poker, DotA 2, and Starcraft 2. I used to be particularly good at Starcraft 2:
	I was ranked #75 in the western hemisphere at my peak.
</p>
<small>*For video games I also use Annihilator and Beyond as handles.</small>
