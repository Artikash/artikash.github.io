<h2><code>this</code>: C++ vs JavaScript</h2>
<p>
	As a quick google search for "this javascript" will show you, the <code>this</code> keyword is an unending source of
	confusion in JavaScript. Meanwhile in C++, the <code>this</code> keyword causes hardly any confusion, even though it
	works almost the exact same way! So let's discu-
</p>
<h3>
	<i>Um, WHAT!? <code>this</code> works completely differently in those languages!</i>
</h3>
<p>
	No, the <code>this</code> keyword behaves very similarly in C++ and JavaScript
	<sup id="_1"><a href="#1_">[1]</a></sup>. It is a (typically) hidden argument passed to a function (typically) when
	it is a member of an object, and is a reference to the object that the function is a member of. The following
	snippets show the typical way you use <code>this</code> in C++, JavaScript, and other object oriented languages such
	as Java and Python:
</p>
<div class="compare">
	<pre><code>struct Stopwatch {
	time_t start = time(nullptr);
	void reset() { this->start = time(nullptr); }
	int lap() { return time(nullptr) - this->start; }
};
auto stopwatch = new Stopwatch;
stopwatch->reset(); // passes stopwatch as this</code></pre>
	<pre><code>class Stopwatch {
	constructor() { this.start = new Date; }
	reset() { this.start = new Date; }
	lap() { return new Date - this.start; }
};
const stopwatch = new Stopwatch;
stopwatch.reset(); // passes stopwatch as this</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>How <code>this</code> leads to problems:</h3>
<p>
	So that works perfectly. What makes <code>this</code> confusing is when you move to higher levels of abstraction.
	C++ and JavaScript both allow you to treat any function as a first-class value: you can store it in a variable and
	pass it to other functions. Say you have a function which expects a function returning a number as an argument:
</p>
<div class="compare">
	<pre><code>void log(std::function&lt;int()&gt; func) { std::cout << func(); }
log(stopwatch->lap); // compile time error!</code></pre>
	<pre><code>function log(func) { console.log(func()); }
log(stopwatch.lap); // also throws an error, but...</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
	The fundamental mistake being made here is the choice of function passed to <code>log</code>.
	<code>log</code> expects a function taking no arguments, <strong>not even a <code>this</code> argument</strong>, but
	it's being called with a function that does take a <code>this</code> argument. To my knowledge, this scenario is
	what typically causes confusion with <code>this</code> in JavaScript: programmers try to pass their function to
	another function, not understanding that when their function gets called, because it's stored as an argument it's
	not a member of an object, so it won't be called with a <code>this</code> argument.
</p>
<p>
	This fundamental mistake manifests very differently between the two languages. In JavaScript, you get a runtime
	error <strong>inside <code>lap</code></strong> once it finds out its <code>this</code> argument isn't what it
	expected. In C++ you get a compile error
	<strong>
		the instant you type <code>stopwatch->lap</code> and don't call it. C++ knows that makes no sense
		<sup id="_2"><a href="#2_">[2]</a></sup> because of the type system:
	</strong>
	<code>lap</code> is no ordinary function returning a number, but a member function returning a number. This doesn't
	mean it's impossible to use member functions as first-class values in C++ - it is! You just have to access them
	differently:
</p>
<pre><code>log(&Stopwatch::lap); // wait, this is still a compile error...</code></pre>
<p>
	Yeah, because that code only fixes the syntax error of how to access <code>lap</code>. You now hit a type error
	because <code>log</code> takes a <code>std::function&lt;int()&gt;</code> - a function taking no arguments. This is
	the same fundamental problem as the JavaScript code - <code>lap</code> expects a <code>this</code> argument, but
	you're sending it to a place where it won't get one. As before, C++ knows it makes no sense to pass
	<code>lap</code> like this thanks to the type system, and shuts you down the instant you try.
</p>
<h3>Fixing the problem:</h3>
<p>
	If you've used JavaScript a lot, you've probably run into this before and thus know the solution - either bind
	<code>this</code> to what you want or capture the <code>this</code> argument you want in a lambda. Indeed, this is
	the solution in C++ as well:
</p>
<div class="compare">
	<pre><code>log(std::bind(&Stopwatch::lap, stopwatch));
log([&] { return stopwatch->lap(); });</code></pre>
	<pre><code>log(stopwatch.lap.bind(stopwatch)); // could use Stopwatch.prototype.lap too
log(() => stopwatch.lap());</code></pre>
</div>
<p>All four of those will do exactly what you want :)</p>
<h3>Why <code>this</code> is only a problem in JavaScript:</h3>
<p>
	The biggest reason <code>this</code> causes so much grief in JavaScript specifically is coding style. You only run
	into these sorts of problems when mixing functional programming (specifically, treating functions as first-class
	values) with object oriented programming (where <code>this</code> is a hidden parameter to functions). This has been
	a core part of JavaScript since its inception, while C++ only recently gained the functional capabilities shown in
	this post. The capabilities of the language dictate how people will program, and since JavaScript has supported
	functional and object oriented programming for so long, programmers commonly mix the two. Many C++ programmers use
	object oriented or generic programming almost exclusively even to this day.
</p>
<p>
	On top of the fact that the required coding style is very rare in C++, on the few occasions you do run into it you
	will find it much less confusing due to the type system. Notice how when you fail to take account of the
	<code>this</code> argument in C++, your code not only fails to compile, but the error message references the actual
	place where you made a mistake (the faulty call to <code>log</code>). This is the power of a good type system - it
	stops you from doing absurd things. That's not the only way the type system protects you from <code>this</code>.
	Because C++ considers class member functions a different type than standalone functions, it can easily stop you from
	using <code>this</code> in standalone functions. JavaScript has no such distinction, so the best you could hope for
	is an error as you call a function, though in practice it passes <code>undefined</code> and hopes for the best.
</p>
<h3>TypeScript to the rescue? Well, someday:</h3>
<p>
	So if the reason <code>this</code> is easy to deal with in C++ is because it has a type system, you might've thought
	<i>is this also the case for TypeScript?</i> In theory, yes. TypeScript allows you to declare an explicit type for
	<code>this</code> and refuses to compile when that type isn't passed.
</p>
<pre><code>class Stopwatch {
	start = new Date;
	reset(this: Stopwatch) { this.start = new Date; }
	lap(this: Stopwatch) { return +new Date - +this.start; }
};
const stopwatch = new Stopwatch;
stopwatch.reset(); // OK
function log(f: (this: void) => number) { console.log(f()); }
log(stopwatch.lap.bind(stopwatch)); // OK
log(stopwatch.lap); // compile error :)</code></pre>
<p>
	Well isn't that just perfect, TypeScript has protected us from faulty <code>this</code> use! Unfortunately, you can
	actually omit the <code>this</code> declaration from either function signature - in this case either
	<code>lap</code> or <code>f</code> - and TypeScript will compile this no problem, even with all of the strictest
	options. In my experience, very few libraries specify the <code>this</code> parameter of their callbacks. Until they
	do, <code>this</code> will continue to be a minefield in TypeScript.
</p>
<p>
	I can't say the TypeScript team is in the wrong for making it work like this, since a huge amount of working code
	would break if <code>this</code> checking was as strict as other function parameters. For now, just try to type all
	your <code>this</code> parameters in your own codebases, and please spread awareness - I've known several pretty
	experienced TypeScript devs that didn't even know you can do this. Once <code>this</code> types are prolific enough,
	we might be able to switch some codebases to strictly check <code>this</code> seamlessly, and then it would have a
	reasonable shot of being added to TypeScript!

<small class="footnote" id="2_">
	<sup><a href="#_2">[2]</a></sup>Well it doesn't exactly make <strong>no</strong> sense. But it is confusing whether
	<code>stopwatch->lap</code> uses the semantics of JavaScript (i.e. <code>&Stopwatch::lap</code>) or the semantics of
	Java (i.e. <code>std::bind_front(&Stopwatch::lap, stopwatch)</code>). I'm speculating here, but I think this is why
	the C++ standardization committee have decided to not allow this construct.
