<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	Hello! My real name is Akash Mozumdar, but online I typically use the handle Artikash*. I'm a software engineer at
	<a href="https://stellarscience.com">Stellar Science</a> and currently live very close to the main office in
	Albuquerque. I've created several open source software projects, most notably
	<a href="https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor">Textractor</a>, and I occasionally contribute to other peoples'. I
	love strategy games including Chess, Poker, DotA 2, and Starcraft 2. I used to be very good at Starcraft 2: at my
	peak in the summer of 2017, I was ranked #75 in the western hemisphere.
</p>
<small>*For video games I also use Annihilator and Beyond as handles.</small>
